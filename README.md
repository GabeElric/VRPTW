This project solves the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) using two main approaches: an insertion heuristic to build initial solutions, and a Local Search method based on Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) to improve them.


Files:

1. vrptw.py
   - Implements the insertion heuristic.
   - Loads an instance file, applies the heuristic, and saves the generated routes.
   - Computes the total distance and the GAP compared to a known best solution.

2. vrptwLocalSearch.py
   - Loads routes generated by `vrptw.py`.
   - Applies LNS-based local search:
     * Destroys part of the solution by randomly removing customers.
     * Repairs the solution by reinserting customers while respecting capacity and time windows.
   - Iteratively improves the solution until no improvement is found for several iterations.

3. gaps.py
   - Reads files generated by local search (`output_routes_lns_*.txt`).
   - Calculates and reports the GAP between the obtained solution and the best known one.
   - Generates a summary in `gaps_summary.txt`.
